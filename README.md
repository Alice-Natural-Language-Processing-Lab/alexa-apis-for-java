## Alexa APIs for Java

The **Alexa APIs for Java** consists of Java POJOS that represent the 
request and response JSON of Alexa services. These models act as a core 
dependency for the [Alexa Skills Kit Java SDK](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-java)

These model classes are auto-generated using the [JSON schemas](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html)
in the developer documentation.
